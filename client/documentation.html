    <main>
        <p>For this project, I made an website for Yu-Gi-Oh player to find cards with a key word and selected type of card. The users can also choose the max number of results they want to find. The results will show name and a small image of the card matched with the key word the user put. And the name of the card is clickable which will show a bigger image of the card so the user can read the description on it.</p>
        <p>The website has a default key word for those who are not familiar with Yu-Gi-Oh. And the defalue value will change to the previous searched key word after the user did the first search.</p>
